# Day 7: Browser Extensions 

## Extension Manager 

I switched to Zen browser after being a long time user of firefox. I generally do not prefer chormium based browsers and since the recent change in policies at Mozilla, Zen seemed like a good alternative. I have total of 21 extensions in my zen browser.

As the task instructed each individual extension was closely examined to identify permissions that might indicate some discrepancy in the working of the extension. The IDM integration model extension was largely unused so that was removed. The Mitaka extension along with Video Downloader Professional. There were no suspicious extensions found after an examination all their summaries and permissions. 

The browser was restarted but there was not any significant improvement in performance. 

## Malicious Extensions 

Malicious extensions can be quite dangerous because depending on the permissions of the extensions, it can steal credentials through form data, capture keyboard strokes or clipboard data, hijack user sessions or perform fingerprinting that allows for long term tracking. A malicious extension can usually be discovered by unexpected CPU spikes, frequent misdirects or unwanted popups and ads. Such kind of extensions can be mitigated by simply removing them entirely or making sure the permissions for them are confined.
